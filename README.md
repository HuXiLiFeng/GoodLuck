Algorithms for recommendation systems in C#.

Algorithms

[0] Global mean, user mean, item mean filling methods. Those are used for rating prediction.

[1] UserKNN (user-based collaborative filstering), rating prediction, top-N recommendation.

[2] ItemKNN (item-based collaborative filstering), top-N recommendation.

[3] Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.

[4] Biased Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.

[5] SVD++, rating prediction.

[6] Alternating Least Lquares, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.

[7] Friend Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation. (PAKDD2015-Wang)

    Friend Biased Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
    
    Adaptive Friend Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
    
    Adaptive Friend Biased Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
    
    
Evaluation metrics

[1] error metrics: MAE, RMSE

[2] accuracy metrics: Precsion@N, Recall@N

[3] Rank metrics: MAP@N

Examples on data collections

[1] ml-100k, ml-1m, ml-10m

[2] Douban

[3] Epinions
